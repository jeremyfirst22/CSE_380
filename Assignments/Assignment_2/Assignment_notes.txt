Go ahead and test the -fast option as well for problem 0

problem 3: We will want to do this calculation in log space. This will prevent overflow when calculating factorial of larger integers. 
We will also likely need to fit a curve to compute or extrapolate. Or write a new test that will keep going untill les than 0.1% accuracy. Relative erro not absolute error. 

Use a linear fit extrapolation

It will happen less than 1000
